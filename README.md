Four days back (16 June 2020 - In the period of Lockdown due to Corona Virus), my phone automatically got fucked up. I slept at around 3:00 am with 6% battery in my Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (awesome camera, much data - my camscanner data, some important photos (includes images of someone special), some passwords, notes, etc., some backed up and some not, and a broken AMOLED screen). When I woke up at around 12:00 pm in the morning, it was no shock to me that my cell phone is not starting, since the battery may have been drained out. I put my phone up on charging and got busy doing some early morning (afternoon) stuff. After 5 minutes (can't do much without checking WhatsApp messages :p), I checked my phone and it was not turning on. I tried all changing of chargers, checking charger, etc. but all in vain.<br>
So now today, all my efforts to get my phone running up again, turned to vain. The mobile mechanic told that some part of the motherboard is shortcircuited (In three days, he could find out this only) and either I need to take it to the Service center for a new change of mother board (which would cost me around 6-7k INR and 4.5k for the new AMOLED display change) or keep it with him for few days so that he could look for an alternative (maybe by replacing few parts on the MB or changing some capacitors). So my choice was to not to choose from any of these options and bring back my phone, and ask my parents to contribute some amount for my new phone. <br>
Till the time I can make my parents ready for a new phone. I found a little bit of stuff that I could try myself (if I could get the required components) to repair the phone/recover the data or would definitely try sometime (motive of making this repo). <br> <br>
